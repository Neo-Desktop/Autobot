The future of IRC bots is here! Xelhua gives to you, Auto 3.0, a new version of
the popular Auto IRC bot.

Bug fixes:

* Fixed significant state mismatched data bugs.

We thank you for choosing Auto. Please remember that he is coming to late
development stages soon, and testers are needed! But we hope we've piqued
your interest, as Auto's upcoming module repository will allow modules to be
created by anyone and uploaded there for everyone to use.

Auto's goal is to create an efficient, stable and highly customizable IRC bot
in Perl. To offer an alternative to other platforms.

Enjoy Auto 3.0.0 Alpha 11!
